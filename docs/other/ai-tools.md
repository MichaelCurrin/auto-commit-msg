# AI tools

Search for "gpt commit" in the extensions marketplace and you'll see plenty of extensions that use GPT to write your commit message.

e.g. [GPT Commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DmytroBaida.gpt-commit)

If done well, this could be even more flexible and natural than Auto Commit Msg which has no AI (but at least handles basic messages for a variety of cases based on the files that changed rather than the contents).

Though the downside for the AI tools they need an API key (pay, or only free limited time) and you are a limited by the processing and network speed. Also, I don't know if GPT is powerful enough to figure out the context of what you are doing and intend to write, as some of the reasoning for a change won't be covered by code itself but by real world events and requirements.
