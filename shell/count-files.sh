# Proof of concept script to use Bash to produce report of file counts from git
# status.
#
# Run this as a standalone report, not for use as a hook.
# If you use this as a hook, it will print output in the console only and
# not add to commit message.
#
# See simple-hook.sh script for how CHANGES would get written out to a commit
# message file.
#
# This script will get count of files added, modified, deleted and renamed/moved
# and output it. Note that modified and renamed/moved can both apply to the same
# file.
# This does not support 'C' (copied).
#
# This report uses git status and passes it do the steps below to parse it.
# A more flexible approach (for unit tests for example) would be for this
# script to handle the status and call another script to do the parsing and
# result. Then the script could be used separate from git and so accept a
# filename or stdin.

# Status summary excluding untracked files using a flag.
CHANGES=$(git status -s -uno --porcelain)

# Note quotes AND -n to preserve newlines so line count for grep, for start
# of lines works.
FILES=$(echo -n "$CHANGES" | wc -l)
