## Preview

Starting from an empty commit message, the extension created a recommended message and populated it inside the Git pane of VS Code:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg/raw/master/docs/_media/sample-chore.png"
        alt="sample screenshot of chore"
        width="300" />
</div>

<!-- TODO: Add GIF here -->

## Features

Just click the extension's one **button** in the Git pane.

This is what the extension can do:

- Look at any **staged** changes files, otherwise falls back to all unstaged changes.
- Generate a commit message, which you can use or edit.
- It can describe a variety of changes - when a file is added, removed, moved, renamed, etc.
- Can handle multiple files at once.
- Based on paths and extensions, infers a **Conventional Commit** prefix type e.g. `feat`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `build(deps)`, `docs`.

See more info on the [Features](/docs/features.md) page in the docs.


## Comparison with other extensions

Other extensions usually require some manual input, such as selecting prefix type from a droplist or writing a commit message by hand along with other form parameters.

This extension takes _zero_ parameters. Just click a button.

## Why not generate a commit message with AI?

This extension does not use AI. With the explosion of AI tools, you can find alternatives to this extension which use do AI - see notes here under [AI tools](/docs/other/ai-tools.md).


## Sample usage

Here are some screenshots of what messages the extension generates based on changed files.

If you created a new file and staged it:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg/raw/master/docs/_media/sample-feat.png" alt="feat" title="feat" width="250" />
</div>

If you updated a build-related file:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg/raw/master/docs/_media/sample-build.png" alt="build" title="build" width="250" />
</div>

If updated a file in `docs/` or a `README.md` anywhere:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg/raw/master/docs/_media/sample-docs.png" alt="docs" title="docs" width="250" />
</div>

If you renamed a file:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg/raw/master/docs/_media/sample-rename.png" alt="rename" title="rename" width="250" />
</div>
